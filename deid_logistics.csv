From my past experience as Assistant Director at the Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative, I have ample event planning and outreach skills and am comfortable representing the organization professionally to external parties. 

With that said, I'm not the most familiar with the tech network in Beijing specifically, and whether I'm the right fit would depend on what exactly events/outreach was in the cards. My strongest interest is in driving professional development of members through field trips and individual speakers focusing on career paths, and less so panel events or other substantive discussion. Happy to chat in person if me being involved makes sense!"
